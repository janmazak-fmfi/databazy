# Cviƒçenie 3

SQL queries:
* [VIEW](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-views/),
* [aggregate functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-agg.html),
* [pattern matching](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-matching.html),
* universal quantifier.


## Tasks

1. Download into a common directory the following files:
	- [employee.sql](employee.sql) --- SQL commands for creating the database and filling it with data
	- [queries.sql](queries.sql) --- the list of queries you should write

2. Study the structure of the database tables `employee`, `department` and `project`. Ask if you don't understand some of the attributes / columns.

3. Create a `VIEW` that would show project number, project name, and the number of employees working on it. Check that it works when retrieving data.

4. Write the queries in SQL using a database of your choice.
Note: for regular expressions, we suggest to use PostgreSQL which supports them out of the box, [unlike SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html#regexp).


## Instructions

Points are awarded for two queries described in `queries.sql` (1 pt each).

The queries you write should preferably run under both PostgreSQL and SQLite (in particular, avoid `==` that is not accepted by PostgreSQL).

Send the solutions to `jan.mazak@fmph.uniba.sk` with subject `DAV-C-03`
(not as images, but as text in the body of the e-mail or in an attachment).
