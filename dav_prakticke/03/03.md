SQL queries:
* [aggregate functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-agg.html),
* pattern matching with [LIKE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-matching.html),
* universal quantifier.

## Tasks

1. Download into a common directory the following files:
	- [employee.sql](employee.sql) --- SQL commands for creating the database and filling it with data
	- [queries.sql](queries.sql) --- the list of queries you should write

2. Study the structure of the database tables `employee`, `department` and `project`. Ask if you don't understand some of the attributes / column names.

3. Write the queries in SQL using a database of your choice. Feel free to consult with colleagues or the teacher.

4. Points are awarded for two particular queries described in `queries.sql`. Send the solutions to `jan.mazak@fmph.uniba.sk` with subject `DAV-C-03` (not as images, but as text in the body of the e-mail or in an attachment).
