Recursive SQL queries:
* [recursion in PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-with.html)
* [recursion in SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_with.html)
* [examples of queries with CTE](recursion_examples.sql)
* [array functions in PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-array.html)


## Tasks

We will work with 3 different databases. SQL statements to create them:
  - [graph_search.sql](graph_search.sql)
  - [employee.sql](employee.sql)
  - [roads.sql](roads.sql)

Use your local database or the server `cvika` as needed ([instructions](../../technical_info/sql.md)).

#### No database

Write the following recursive queries:
1. Compute the value of `n!` for `n = 10`.
2. Compute the 30th Fibonacci number.

#### Trees and graphs

Take a look at `graph_search.sql` which contains the queries from the lecture.
Run them and verify they work correctly (it is helpful to draw the oriented graphs we are searching).

3. **(1 point)** Write a query that computes the probability of decisions in the
	[decision / probability tree](https://www.statisticshowto.com/how-to-use-a-probability-tree-for-probability-questions/) given in the table `tree`. The output should include a single pair `[leaf, probability]` for each leaf (i.e. a vertex that has no outgoing edges).

#### Employees

For the database `employee.sql`, write the following recursive queries:

4. **(1 point)** List all the direct and indirect subordinates of each employee (as determined by the attribute `superior`). The result should be triples `[employee_name, subordinate_name, 'direct'/'indirect']`. Do not include employees with no subordinates.

#### Roads

For the database `roads.sql`, write the following recursive queries:

5. **(1 point)** List pairs `[city, path]` where `city` is a city reachable from Rome (each such city should be included in exactly one pair) and `path` is an array containing names of all the cities along one of the ways from Rome to `city` that contains the least number of cities.

6. List of all cities reachable from Rome by travelling at most 1000 km. Your query does not need to be efficient, you can just find all paths and compute their length one by one. (You might want to use `unnest` to work with an array.)
Take a look at an [implementation of Dijkstra algorithm in SQL](http://aprogrammerwrites.eu/?p=1391), and never forget that often it is possible to get the whole graph from the db and run algorithms written in a less unwieldy language locally, or use scripting languages within the db, even Python.

7. Compute the number of components of the road graph. (Hint: consider assigning a unique representative to each component and then map each city to a representative.)


## Instructions

The queries you write should preferably run under both PostgreSQL and SQLite.

Send the solutions to `jan.mazak@fmph.uniba.sk` with subject `DAV-C-06`.
