Simple SQL queries, SQLite.

#### Relevantná dokumentácia:

* [SELECT](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-select.html)
* [comments](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_comments.asp) in SQL
* `LIKE` operator (documentation: [W3C](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_like.asp), [SQLite](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-like/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-tutorial/postgresql-like/), [SQL Server](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-basics/sql-server-like/))
* [export CSV](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-export-csv/)
* [export JSON](https://database.guide/format-sqlite-results-as-json/)
* [SQLite CLI](https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html) (command line interface)


## Tasks

1. Do the first 4 lessons in an [interactive tutorial](https://sqlbolt.com/lesson/select_queries_introduction).

2. Try connecting to the server `cvika` and check that you can login succesfully ([instructions](../../technical_info/technical.md)).

3. Download into a common directory (on `cvika` or your computer) the following files:
	- [employee.sql](employee.sql) --- SQL commands for creating the database and filling it with data
	- [queries.sql](queries.sql) --- the list of queries you should write

4. Study the structure of the database table `employee`. Ask if you don't understand some of the attributes / column names.

5. Set up an SQLite database ([instructions](../../technical_info/sql.md)) and run the queries. The SQL statement for the first one is already written in the file `queries.sql`. Check the query result against the database content described in `employee.sql`.

6. Write a couple more queries on your own and check the results.
You can discuss and compare them with others around you (but don't overdo it for queries for which you receive points).

7. Experiment with the `LIKE` operator (check the documentation links given above).

8. Vyskúšajte zmeniť formát výpisu dát v [SQLite CLI](https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html#changing_output_formats).

9. Exportujte nejaké dáta z SQLite databázy do formátu CSV a do formátu JSON.


## Instructions

Points are awarded for two queries described in `queries.sql` (1 pt each).

The queries you write should preferably run under both PostgreSQL and SQLite (in particular, avoid `==` that is not accepted by PostgreSQL).

Send the solutions to `jan.mazak@fmph.uniba.sk` with subject `DAV-C-01`
(not as images, but as plain text in the body of the e-mail or in an attachment).
