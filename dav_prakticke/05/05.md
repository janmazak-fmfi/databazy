## Advice for adding test data

Advice like this should not be taken as gospel; consider it an inspiration for further thought.
* DON'T use long meaningless names in TEXT fields.
* DO use meaningful names for entries with specific properties, e.g. 'readerThatNeverBorrowed'
(instead of some name you are familiar with, but does not hint
at properties relevant to the task at hand).
* DO use short artificial names for both people and books,
e.g. 'r01' and 'r02' for readers and 'b01' for a book.
It would be easier to extend the dataset later.
(This might not work well if you are dyslexic.)
* DO consider writing a script generating the SQL commands
filling the database with data. It's likely an overkill for this task,
but necessary if you are interested in performance of queries.


## Tasks

1. On a computer with _PostgreSQL_ set up (e.g. `cvika`, see [instructions](../../technical_info/sql.md)), download into a common directory the following files:
	- [library.sql](library.sql) --- SQL commands for creating the database and filling it with data
	- [queries.sql](queries.sql) --- the list of queries you should write

2. Study the structure of the database tables. Pay close attention to columns that can be `NULL` (those that are not marked `NOT NULL` or `PRIMARY KEY`), in particular, `returnDate` in `borrowing`. Such fields need a meaningful interpretation for NULL values (e.g. "value exists, but is unknown", "value does not exist for that particular row", "event has not happened (yet)").

3. Since the database is empty, you need to fill it with some data to test/verify your queries.
Don't do it randomly, take a look at a query you want to test against the database first.
A suitable way is to use `INSERT` statements added to `library.sql` --- in general, you want to be able to use the INSERT statements repeatedly (notice the `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` at the beginning of `library.sql`), so don't just write them into an interactive terminal (e.g. `psql`).
Also, there's no need to use the same data to test every query, so you might want to comment out stuff added previously.

4. Add a new table `book_backup` with structure identical to `book`. Use [`INSERT INTO SELECT`](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_insert_into_select.asp) to copy all data from `book` to the backup table.


## Instructions

Points are awarded for two particular queries described in `queries.sql` (1 pt each).

The queries you write **must run under PostgreSQL**.
