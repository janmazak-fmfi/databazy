# Cviƒçenie 2

SQL queries with joins and WHERE NOT EXISTS:
* [SELECT](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-select.html)
* [joins](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-tutorial/postgresql-joins/)
* [NOT EXISTS subqueries](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-subquery.html#FUNCTIONS-SUBQUERY-EXISTS)


## Tasks

1. Connect to the server `cvika` ([instructions](../../technical_info/technical.md)).

2. Download into a common directory the following files:
	- [employee.sql](employee.sql) --- SQL commands for creating the database and filling it with data
	- [queries.sql](queries.sql) --- the list of queries you should write

3. Study the structure of the database tables `employee` and `department`. Ask if you don't understand some of the attributes / column names.

4. Set up a PostgreSQL database ([instructions](../../technical_info/sql.md)) and run the queries. The SQL statement for the first one is already written in the file `queries.sql`. Check the query result against the database content described in `employee.sql`.

5. Write a couple of queries using PostgreSQL and then continue writing the queries using a database of your choice. Feel free to consult with colleagues or the teacher (don't overdo it for queries for which you receive points).


## Instructions

Points are awarded for queries described in `queries.sql` (1 pt each).

The queries you write should preferably run under both PostgreSQL and SQLite (in particular, avoid `==` that is not accepted by PostgreSQL).

Send the solutions to `jan.mazak@fmph.uniba.sk` with subject `DAV-C-02`
(not as images, but as plain text in the body of the e-mail or in an attachment).
