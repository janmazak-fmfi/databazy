## Tasks

1. The database to use is [employee.sql](employee.sql).

2. Take a brief overview of the documents linked above. You should at least understand how to comfortably write median computation in SQL.

3. Write the queries described in [queries.sql](queries.sql).


## Instructions

Points are awarded for two particular queries described in `queries.sql` (1 pt each).

The queries you write should preferably run under both PostgreSQL and SQLite.

Send the solutions to `jan.mazak@fmph.uniba.sk` with subject `DAV-C-07`.
