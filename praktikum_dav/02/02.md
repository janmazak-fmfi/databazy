Rather simple SQL queries:
* [SELECT](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-select.html)
* [NOT EXISTS subqueries](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-subquery.html#FUNCTIONS-SUBQUERY-EXISTS)

## Tasks

1. Download into a common directory the following files:
	- [employee.sql](employee.sql) --- SQL commands for creating the database and filling it with data
	- [queries.sql](queries.sql) --- the list of queries you should write

2. Study the structure of the database tables `employee` and `department`. Ask if you don't understand some of the attributes / column names.

3. Try connecting to the server `cvika` and check that you can login succesfully ([instructions](../../technical_info/technical.md)).

4. Set up an SQLite database ([instructions](../../technical_info/sql.md)) and run the queries. The SQL statement for the first one is already written in the file `queries.sql`. Check the query result against the database content described in `employee.sql`.

5. Write a couple more queries on your own and check the results (you could compare them with others around you).

6. Set up a PostgreSQL database ([instructions](../../technical_info/sql.md)) and run the queries again.

7. Continue writing the queries using a database of your choice. Feel free to consult with colleagues or the teacher.
