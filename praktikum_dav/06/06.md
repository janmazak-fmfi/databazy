Recursive SQL queries:
* [recursion in PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-with.html)
* [examples of queries with CTE](recursion_examples.sql)

## Tasks

1. Download into a common directory the following files with SQL statements to create database relations:
	- [employee.sql](employee.sql)
	- [roads.sql](roads.sql)

2. Create the database or use the server `cvika` as needed ([instructions](../../technical_info/sql.md)).

3. Write the following recursive queries:

* compute the value of `n!` for `n = 10`
* compute the 30th Fibonacci number
* list all the direct and indirect subordinates for each manager from the database of employees (include the info on whether it is a direct or indirect subordinate)
* list of all cities that are reachable from Rome (together with the number of cities one passes through on the way for each city)
* list of all cities reachable from Rome by travelling at most 1000 km
* list of triples `[T, D, Cities]` where `T` is a town, `D` is an integer, and `Cities` is the number of cities reachable from `T` in at most `D` days by a truck (which can travel at most 720 km a day); only include rows with `Cities > 0`
* compute the number of components of the road graph (hint: consider assigning a unique representant to each component and then map each city to a representant)

Note: you are expected to provide solutions to *at least 5 of the 7 query tasks to achieve 2 points*.
